## Overview

Basically, the challene in the project is to design a 3 column layout page that is centered in the middle of the screen and adapt it for a mobile screen as well.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to reinforcde my knowledge of CSS grid and how it works in this assignment. I had a major challenge of applying margin to a button and it was not reflecting in the browser and then I found out that links are by default inline element which was why it bahave that way, so until i changes the display type to inline-block it was not responding to that css command. This was really exciting.

### Continued development

I would really love to build more complex layouts with CSS Grid, I look forward to the learning process.
